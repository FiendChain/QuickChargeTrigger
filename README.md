### Introduction
A small program that allows for an ATMEL chip to communicate over USB D+ and D- using the quick charge interface.
Allows for setting of different voltage ranges from the quick charge supported power bank/supply.
Vout = 5V, 9V, 12V, CONTINUOUS

CONTINUOUS allows you to increment/decrement the voltage in 0.2V increments for finer control.

### Instructions
Open the ATMEL studio editor on the .atsln file. Then compile and upload to the desired chip.
